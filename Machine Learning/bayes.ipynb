    "*Classification* is one form of supervised learning. The aim is to annotate all data points with a label. Those points that have the same label belong to the same class. There can be two or more labels. For example, a lifeform can be classified (coarsely) with labels animal, plant, fungi, archaea, bacteria, protozoa, and chromista. The data points are observed to have certain features that can be used to predict their labels. For example, if it is has feathers, then it is most likely an animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning an algorithm is first given a training set of data points with their features and labels. Then the algorithm learns from these features and labels a (probabilistic) model, which can afterwards be used to predict the labels of previously unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Naive Bayes classification* is a fast and simple to understand classification method. Its speed is due to some simplifications we make about the underlying probability distributions, namely, the assumption about the independence of features. Yet, it can be quite powerful, especially when there are enough features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have for each label L a probability distribution. This distribution gives probability for each possible combination of features (a feature vector):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(features | L).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea in Bayesian classification is to reverse the direction of dependence: we want to predict the label based on the features:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(L | features)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is possible by [the Bayes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(L | features) = \\frac{P(features | L)P(L)}{P(features)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have to labels L1 and L2, and their associated distributions: $P(features | L1)$ and $P(features | L2)$. If we have a data point with \"features\", whose label we don't know, we can try to predict it using the ratio of posterior probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{P(L1 | features)}{P(L2 | features)} = \\frac{P(features | L1)P(L1)}{P(features | L2)P(L2)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ratio is greater than one, we label our data point with label L1, and if not, we give it label L2.\n",
    "The prior probabilities P(L1) and P(L2) of labels can be easily found out from the input data, as for each data point we also have its label. Same goes for the probabilities of features conditioned on the label."
